1.	Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7

#list1 = [ number for number in range(7,1000) if number%7 == 0]

2.	Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them

#li = [ num for num in range(1000) if '3' in str(num)]

3.	Count the number of spaces in a string

#sentence = 'Back to back comedy scenes of AVS _ _ _'
#li = [letter for letter in sentence if letter == ' ']
#print len(li)

4.	Remove all of the vowels in a string

# sentence = 'List comprehensions Are one Of the unique features of python'
# li = [letter for letter in sentence if letter.lower() not in ['a','e','i','o','u']]
# print ''.join(li)

5.	Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters

# sentence = 'List comprehensions Are one Of the unique features of python'
# li = [word for word in sentence.split() if len(word)<4]
# print li

Challenge:
6.	Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in a sentence.
7.	Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)
8.	For all the numbers 1-1000, use a nested list/dictionary comprehension to find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by
9.	A list of all consonants in the sentence 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'
10.	A list of all the capital letters (and not white space) in 'The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dog'
11.	A list of all square numbers formed by squaring the numbers from 1 to 1000.
12.	return a list of the full path to items in a directory (hint, use os.listdir() and os.path.join())
13.	now extend this same one to exclude directories (hint, use os.path.isdir())
14.	now extend it further to filter to only files ending in .jpg and .png
